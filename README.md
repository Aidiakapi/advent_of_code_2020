# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2020, written in Rust.

Use `cargo run --release` to calculate all solutions based on my inputs. You can
run specific days like so: `cargo run --release -- day07 day21`.

If you want to your inputs, simply delete the `inputs` directory, and create a
`token.txt` file containing your AoC session cookie's value. If you run it,
it'll download all your inputs (throttled).

If you would rather not download the inputs, or use arbitrary inputs, you can
manually create files in this format: `inputs/dayXX.txt` where `XX` need to be
replaced with the two-digit day number, such as `07` or `21`.
